checksum error: 
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10352934/svn-checksum-mismatch-while-updating
   Just to recap:
   1. Go to the folder with the file causing problems
   2. do svn update --set-depth empty (note: this will delete your files, so make a copy first!)
   3. do svn update --set-depth infinity

problem deleting folder / can not commit update first:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1786687/svn-undo-delete-before-commit
   1. do svn revert . --recursive
   2. parse output for errors like
      "Failed to revert 'dir1/dir2' -- try updating instead."
      ( or go through the restored folders "Reverted 'dir1/dir2'")
   3. call svn up for each of error directories:
      svn up dir1/dir2
